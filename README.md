# CloudCap3D: Enhancing 3D In-Scene Descriptions via Point Cloud Integration and Efficient Text Filtering
We publicly release the CloudCap3D dataset. The motivation for creating this dataset is to address the issue of low-quality and semantically poor generated text caused by the lack of 3D point cloud data. We leverage the existing Objaverse dataset and expand it into CloudCap3D, a dataset with 3D object-text pairs, providing a large number of 3D object-text pairs with richer semantics.
The dataset can be used for 3D multimodal tasks.
